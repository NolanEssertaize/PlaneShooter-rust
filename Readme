A high-performance 3D ballistic simulation and predictive aimbot developed in **Rust** using the **Bevy ECS** game engine. This project demonstrates first-order trajectory prediction, entity component systems (ECS) architecture, and 3D vector mathematics.

---

## 📋 Overview

This simulation features a "player" entity capable of firing projectiles at moving targets. It includes a custom implementation of a predictive aiming algorithm that accounts for:
* **Target Velocity** (Leading the target).
* **Projectile Velocity** (Travel time).
* **Gravity Drop** (Ballistic compensation).

The project is structured with a modular architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability, adhering to separation of concerns principles.

## ✨ Key Features

* **ECS Architecture:** Built on Bevy 0.15, utilizing Systems, Components, and Resources strictly.
* **Predictive Ballistics:** mathematically accurate aimbot that solves intercept vectors in real-time.
* **Hybrid Targeting System:**
    * *Manual Mode:* Raycasting from the camera view.
    * *Assist Mode:* Screen-space FOV check + Distance prioritization.
* **Visual Debugging:** Real-time gizmos visualizing the lock-on vector and predicted impact point.
* **Performance:** Optimized utilizing Bevy's parallel system execution and simple spherical collision approximation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Rust & Cargo:** (Latest Stable Channel)
* **Vulkan Support:** A GPU compatible with Vulkan (e.g., AMD RX 7000 series, NVIDIA RTX).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/rust-aimbot-sim.git](https://github.com/your-username/rust-aimbot-sim.git)
    cd rust-aimbot-sim
    ```

2.  **Run the simulation**
    *Debug mode (Fast compilation):*
    ```bash
    cargo run
    ```
    *Release mode (High performance):*
    ```bash
    cargo run --release
    ```

## 🎮 Controls

| Input | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`SPACE`** | **Hold** | Activates the **Aimbot**. Locks onto the target closest to the cursor. |
| **`LMB`** | **Click** | Fires a projectile. |
| **`ESC`** | **Exit** | Closes the window (default Bevy behavior). |
